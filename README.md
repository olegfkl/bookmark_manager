As a makers student
So that I have an overview of all my saved links
I want see a list of links

As a makers student
So that I can update my list of links
I'd like to add new links

As a makers student
So that I can quickly find links
I'd like to see them in chronological order

As a makers student
So that I can efficiently save links
I'd like to add the site's address and title to my bookmark manager

As a makers student
So that I can organize links  
I'd like to be able to add tags

As a makers student
So that I can easily find links
I'd like to filter links by tags
